    <p>I am a physicist currently pursuing a PhD in Chemical Physics at the University of Maryland. I have experience using numerical methods to study dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and optical and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with quantum chemical defects (sp3 defects if you're curious). CNTs and BECs are both fascinating forms of matter, and I strongly suggest reading up on them if you are interested in science. A BEC is a strange quantum state of matter, wherein a gas of identical bosonic particles are all doing the <em>exact same thing</em>, in the <em>exact same way</em>, in the <em>exact same place</em>! A macroscopic wavefunction. A CNT is a tube made out of a single layer of graphite which is seamlessly rolled into a cylinder, and has a diameter on the order of 1 nanometer. Roughly speaking, that means you can take a single hair from your head, and lay down 100,000 CNTs across the diameter of that strand of hair!</p>

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing soccer (or football, depending on who is asking), trying my hand at art and music, physical exercise, browsing the Wikipedia, or just chatting with friends (ideally over delicious food). Also rotting my brain with TV and Youtube. Also, playing video games, though rarely nowadays. I might upload some paintings and whatnot here later. </p>
    Here are some pdfs:
    <p><a href="Leibniz_Integral_Formula-1.pdf">derivation of the Leibniz integral formula</a></p> 
    <p><a href="PDEs_Project____GPE_derivation-1.pdf">derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for BECs</a></p>
