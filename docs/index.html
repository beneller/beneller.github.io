    <p>I am a physicist currently pursuing a PhD in Chemical Physics at the University of Maryland (defended March 14). I have experience using numerical methods to study dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and optical and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with quantum chemical defects (sp3 defects if you're curious). CNTs and BECs are both fascinating forms of matter, and I strongly suggest reading up on them if you are interested in science. A BEC is a strange quantum state of matter, wherein a gas of identical bosonic particles are all doing the <em>exact same thing</em>, in the <em>exact same way</em>, in the <em>exact same place</em>! A macroscopic wavefunction. A CNT is a tube made out of a single layer of graphite which is seamlessly rolled into a cylinder, and has a diameter on the order of 1 nanometer. Roughly speaking, that means you can take a single hair from your head, and lay down 100,000 CNTs across the diameter of that strand of hair!</p>

    <p>During the course of my PhD research on fluorescent ultrashort nanotube (FUN) materials, I have developed a Python package to aid in the generation of designer molecules. We are currently preparing this for publication, and I hope to continue developing this package as a valuable open source tool for researchers designing and studying nanomaterials, molecular assemblies, clusters and more. It works in a complementary way to more traditional generating codes, such as those based on crystal unit cells or GUI-based programs, and allows the user to create, calculate, and visualize structures that would be tedious or impractical to create with existing codes. If you are interested, check back for updates, and feel free to reach out to me if you want to participate in further development of the package! </p>
    
    <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing soccer (or football, depending on who is asking), trying my hand at art and music, physical exercise, browsing the Wikipedia, or just chatting with friends (ideally over delicious food). I might upload some paintings and whatnot here later. </p>
    Here are some pdfs:
