    <p>Personal and professional webpage, work-in-progress. </p>
    <p>I am a physicist currently pursuing a PhD in Chemical Physics at the University of Maryland. I have experience using numerical methods to study dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and optical and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with quantum chemical defects (sp3 defects if you're curious).</p>

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing soccer (or football, depending on who is asking!), trying my hand at art and music, physical exercise, browsing the Wikipedia, or just chatting with friends (ideally over delicious food). Also rotting my brain with TV and Youtube. Also, playing video games, though rarely nowadays. I might upload some paintings and whatnot here later. </p>
