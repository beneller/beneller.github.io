    <p>I am a physicist who recently obtained my PhD in Chemical Physics from the University of Maryland (Spring 2025). I have experience using numerical methods to study dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and optical and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with quantum chemical defects (sp3 defects). CNTs and BECs are both fascinating examples of matter, and I strongly suggest reading up on them if you are interested in science. A BEC is a strange quantum state of matter, wherein a gas of identical bosonic particles are all doing the <em>exact same thing</em>, in the <em>exact same way</em>, in the <em>exact same place</em>! A macroscopic wavefunction, roughly speaking. A CNT is a tube made out of a single layer of graphite which is seamlessly rolled into a cylinder, and has a diameter on the order of 1 nanometer. Roughly speaking, that means you can take a single hair from your head, and lay down 100,000 CNTs across the diameter of that strand of hair!</p>

    <p>During the course of my PhD research on fluorescent ultrashort nanotube (FUN) materials, I have developed a Python module <em>ChemG</em> to aid in the generation of designer molecules. You can find the code at <a href="https://github.com/beneller/ChemG" target="_blank">https://github.com/beneller/ChemG</a>. I hope to continue developing <em>ChemG</em> as an open source tool for researchers designing and studying nanomaterials, molecular assemblies, clusters and more. It works in a complementary way to traditional molecular generating codes, such as those based on crystal unit cells or GUI-based programs, and allows the user to create, calculate, and visualize structures that would be tedious or impractical to create with existing codes. If you are interested, follow the <em>ChemG</em> repository linked above, and feel free to reach out to me if you want to participate in further development of the package. </p>

    <p>I have used <em>ChemG</em> to aid in the development of a graphic for our article "Clar’s Rule Reveals the Topological Origin of Edge States in π-Conjugated System," which was accepted as the cover story for the 51st issue (12/25/2025) of <em>J. Phys. Chem. Lett.</em>. <em>ChemG</em> was used to generate the initial graphene sheet, and then apply a rippling transformation to it to give it a dynamic appearance. Here is the final published version:</p>

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing soccer and running, trying my hand at art and music, browsing Wikipedia, or just chatting with friends (ideally over delicious food). I might upload some paintings and whatnot here later. </p>
    Here are some pdfs:
